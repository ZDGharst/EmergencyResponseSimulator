# Emergency Response Simulator
This is my final project for my COMP-SCI 404: Introductions to Algorithms & Complexity at UMKC.

I chose to simulate a vehicle dispatch system through C++.

Please view the [Project Report](https://github.com/ZDGharst/EmergencyResponseSimulator/blob/master/docs/GharstZach_CS404_ProjectReport.pdf) for a more formal readme.
